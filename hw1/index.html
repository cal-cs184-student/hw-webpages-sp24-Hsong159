<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p> I rasterized triangles by first finding the bound box of the triangle through finding the minimum and maximum of the x and y coordinate. I made sure to use floor ceil functions to cover every single pixel.  Then I followed the lecture slide and calculated dXi = Xi+1 – Xi and dYi = Yi+1 – Yi. This allowed me to compute Li(x,y) which could be used to determine whether a point is in the edge, on the edge, or outside the edge. If the point is on the edge or in the edge, I would call fill_pixel to fill in the pixel. Then when I was testing my code, I found out that my test6 was wrong. Through ED, I realized that I wasn’t checking the triangle’s winding. I added a test of cross product to determine whether I need to change the order of the points of the triangle.</p>
<p> My algorithm is no worse than the one that check each sample within the bounding box since I am checking each point within the bound box exactly once through my for-loop. My outer for-loop run from x_min to x_max and my inner for-loop run from y_min to y_max.</p>

<p>Below are images of my test4</p>
